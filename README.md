# Underwater-Vehicle-Minimum-Travel-Time-Course
The Underwater Vehicle – Minimum Travel Time Course project explores the design and simulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) optimized to travel between two points in the shortest possible time. By combining mechanical design, fluid dynamics, and intelligent path‑planning algorithms, the vehicle accounts for drag, propulsion efficiency, and environmental constraints to achieve reliable and efficient navigation. The project demonstrates how optimized course planning can reduce energy consumption while maintaining performance, with potential applications in marine exploration, defense, resource mapping, and sustainable ocean research. This work highlights innovation in underwater mobility and practical engineering solutions.
